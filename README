These files include a cryptography toolkit, which has functions to
implement the extended Euclidean algorithm (for calculating greatest common
denominator) and Djikstra's algorithm (also gcd), modular inverses, modular
exponentiation, and primality testing. There's also a (fairly uninteresting)
implementation of the El Gamal cryptosystem which will encrypt and decrypt a
message. 

Gmp libraries are required.


Algorithms based off those in Katz and Lindell's "Introduction to Modern 
Cryptography".
