These files include a cryptography toolkit, which has functions to
implement the extended Euclidean algorithm (for calculating greatest common
denominator) and Djikstra's algorithm (also gcd), modular inverses, modular
exponentiation, and primality testing.

Gmp libraries are required.


Algorithms based off those in Katz and Lindell's "Introduction to Modern 
Cryptography".
